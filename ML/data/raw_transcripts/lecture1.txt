3:15
Welcome on figuring out, sir. I'll tell you a little story. So, during the pandemic,
Raj Shamani x Bill Gates begins
3:20
me and my sister we were watching the Netflix documentary 'Inside Bill's Brain'
3:25
and halfway through it I told my sister that, hey, you know what, like
3:31
one day I'll sit with Bill Gates and I'll directly speak to him and get inside his brain
3:37
and just randomly and she was laughing. So, this one's for you. You did it.
3:43
Yeah, so, it's, it's an opportunity. I don't know how it just came out of our mouth and it's happening today. So, thank you so much for doing this.
Observations on India
3:52
Well, you've come to India quite often. Tell me something
3:57
that you have observed about India, which a lot of people don't know about. Well people probably,
4:04
you know, cause they're here all the time, you know, they probably don't recognize how much things have changed. And if you go away and come back, then you see, wow!
4:13
You know, the level of entrepreneurship and the...
4:18
you know, the amount of innovation that's actually take taking place here, it's
4:24
pretty fantastic and you know, for the foundation, we've been here originally.
4:30
Because a lot of the health challenges were here and we still care a lot about that but
4:37
now a lot of our invention is been done here, whether it's
4:42
well vaccines, obviously. We have some incredible partnerships but it's broadening to,
4:49
you know, better seeds, better diagnostics, you know, the ways that we can use AI
4:56
for health or education. Also the innovation ecosystem has really exploded and that's
5:05
gonna be great for India, it's gonna be great for the world. So, when you meet other leaders around the world
5:10
or when you meet your billionaire friends, what's the first thing you tell them about India? Is it the same thing, what you just told me?
5:19
Yeah, it's, you know, we've had such great experience
5:25
in our work in India, you know, I encourage people to
5:30
come and tap into the great things going on.
5:36
Is that anything specific you tell them? Well, you know, my connections, it goes all the way back to the Microsoft days, when
5:44
you know, we at first would hire people from India and bring them to the United States
5:49
and you know both the United States and India were kind of mad at us because we were taking you know the smart people and moving them and...
5:57
you know, then they came back here to India and created the Microsoft India
6:02
work which has, you know, been absolutely fantastic. So, you know, up until the year 2000, I mainly knew the tech
6:11
scene. So, you know, lot of Bangalore, Hyderabad.
6:17
Seeing the country more broadly, you know, that's in my foundation work. So, you know, Bihar,
6:23
UP, you know, seeing, you know, where we could partner and and help with things.
6:31
You know, I still want to take more vacation here, I've done it a little bit but... you know, there's a lot of great places in India that I haven't been to.
India: The Global Talent Capital
6:40
Talking about Microsoft and taking people from here to US. People like
6:45
Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, there have been incredible CEOs around the world,
6:52
why do you think India is becoming a global talent capital for the world?
6:57
Do you think anything special here which isn't out there? Well, you know, twenty percent
7:04
of the world's people live here in India and India's had a particular emphasis on,
7:10
you know, engineering, software, you know? And turned out a lot of,
7:15
top people. And so when you get people like Sundar, Satya, who are both great at engineering and management,
7:24
you know, that's a magic combination. And,
7:29
you know, so, they... you know, these companies, you know, are looking anywhere in the world to find
7:36
that mix and... you know? So, India's getting about its fair share of
7:42
those top leadership positions and you know, it partly comes from having great universities,
7:49
you know? Not just the IITs. But starting with them
7:54
you know, that's using the incredible talent that's here. So, talking about Indian talent,
Views on Inheritance
8:02
you do a lot of philanthropy work here and you've met a lot of talented people here, lots of
8:08
rich people here as well. Do you... and you believe that
8:13
all the money that rich people have or like people who have made wealth for themselves, they should use it for charity work, they should pledge it.
8:21
In India, there's a... usually a lot of people believe that, as parents it's their duty to save everything for their kids,
8:28
for the inheritance, right? Like the kids will get everything. What do you think is the right mindset? Using all the money for
8:35
pledging and giving it back to the society or giving it to the children?
8:40
Well, I think, you know, everybody gets to decide on that. You know, in my case,
8:45
you know, my kids got a great
8:51
upbringing and education but, you know, less than one percent of the,
8:57
the total wealth. Because I decided it wouldn't be a favor to them. You know, it's not a dynasty.
9:04
You know, I'm not asking them to run Microsoft. I want to give them a chance to have their own
9:10
earnings and success. You know, be significant and not overshadowed by
9:15
the incredible luck and good fortune I had. And different family see that differently. I think the
9:22
people who've made fortunes from technology are less dynastic
9:29
and... You know? So, they, they'll even, you know, take their capital
9:35
and give a lot of that away. You can have the view of giving away your capital or just giving away your earnings.
9:42
And of course, I love all philanthropy but the tech sectors, they're
9:47
probably the most aggressive about, you know, giving most of
9:52
it away. Not the other sectors, you have not seen that in any other kind of industrial where people try to give...
9:59
Not to the same degree, it tends to be giving more, you know, of the...
10:05
giving some portion of the profit as opposed to the,
10:10
the actual base capital. You know, in India, a lot of kids also fight with their parents on inheritance,
10:18
have your kids ever spoken to you and been like, hey, why are you not giving us everything or anything?
10:23
Has it ever happened? You know, you don't want your kids to ever be confused
10:30
about your support for them and your love for them and so, I do think explaining early on,
10:37
your philosophy. You know, that you're going to treat them all equally and that you're gonna give them incredible opportunities,
10:45
but that, you know, the highest calling for these resources is
10:51
to go back to the neediest, through the foundation. And you know, they've seen the
11:00
success of the foundation, I hope they're very proud of of the foundation and
11:07
so, you know, I... I've seen cases where kids actually tell their parents
11:12
to be more philanthropic. You know, I think the younger generation sometimes actually,
11:18
is pushing against this idea of of uh... You know, the wealth just
11:24
being passed down mostly.
11:29
And So, that's very... So, you know every family's a, a bit different. I have a last question on India and then we'll get to the foundation work and
People He’d Like to Meet Again
11:38
try to understand you as well. If you get an opportunity
11:43
to invite three Indians for dinner, dead or alive.
11:48
Who would that be? Well, I get to spend time with, you know, some incredible
11:55
people in India, you know? I get time with the Prime Minister and understand his vision
12:01
and how we fit into that, this, you know, twenty forty seven
12:07
thing that, you know, every thing is lining up to try to achieve that. You know, I get to meet,
12:14
there was a a great scientist Raj Bhan, who created the department of biotechnology.
12:21
There was a mathematician, Ramanujan, who... I would have loved to have met him because he was,
12:28
you know, almost mysterious how he was so genius at what he was able to do.
12:37
You know, the... I got to work with Ratan Tata, I'm getting to work with all of the amazing philanthropists and
12:46
lot of the innovators here. You know, I get to see small companies. Early on, I just went through
12:52
some of these companies using AI in health some prop for profit, a few
12:59
nonprofit. You know, we had a great twenty fifth...
13:07
twenty five year celebration and this great sitar artist, you know, came and that was
13:14
a pretty special thing. So i'd be hard for me to pick, there's, there's so many
13:20
incredible talents. You can't pick three? I think, I defend
13:25
some people, by not including them.
13:30
Fair, fair. You were talking about small companies, if you were to start something from zero,
Future Possibilities
13:38
in India, today. Where would you put most of your time?
13:43
And what's the first step you'll take? Well, you'd mostly start a company because you think you enjoy working on something new you think you have a world class understanding of,
13:52
you know, a unique contribution. You know, for me that was software, for this day and age, you know, if you think you understand, fusion,
14:03
you know, that's great if you're successful which... that's risky, you know you could really improve the world.
14:11
You know, AI is sort of the today's equivalent of what I did when I was young, to see,
14:18
you know, wow! the possibilities are unlimited
14:24
and so, you know, I'd probably be doing one of these new AI companies if I
14:30
was starting out today. Is it... Do you still feel there's opportunity... a lot of opportunities in AI to build something as significant as what you've built?
14:39
Or it's pretty late? Well, you know, the big companies are
14:45
putting a lot of money into it and the number of companies globally
14:51
is, you know, huge. I mean, you know, many people didn't even know these Chinese
14:57
companies were doing all this work and yet, you know, some of the best results over the last six months, have come from
15:03
three or four of the models there. So, it's not... When I got going in computing, it was a very small set of people and
15:12
you know, people thought we were crazy that... there we set a computer on every desk and a computer in every home
15:19
and that just seemed strange to people because they couldn't see the... they didn't get software and they didn't get the
15:26
exponential improvement of the chips was making computing
15:31
you know basically free. So, it's, I'd say it's tougher
15:39
to get out in front. There will be new companies, I mean Nvidia,
15:45
you know, is almost as valuable as apple and Microsoft
15:50
and yet, you know, they, you know, came into prominence only really in the
15:56
last five or six years, although they're about fifteen years old. So, there are opportunities and there will be some new
16:04
companies that use AI to achieve unbelievable success but it'll be, you know, two or three out of ten thousand
16:12
and, you know, would I be able to do that again? Hard to say. You talked about...
What People Misunderstand About Him
16:18
Like when you started a lot of people thought that what are you doing? This is some random thing these guys are trying to do, they may be
16:26
stupid, they may be thinking too big, whatever, right? And over the time, every time you do something big, usually
16:33
people, do not understand you Or anyone. Like not just you, like
16:38
whoever wants to start something new and big. In today's world or as of today,
16:44
what's the biggest misunderstanding about you? What do you think? What do people misunderstand about Bill Gates?
16:52
Well, whenever you hear about somebody who's got, you know, some degree of power or
16:58
you know, ridiculous amounts of money. You might think they have grand schemes, you know, in their...
17:07
You know, there's also just a sense that you know, their... their values are different
17:12
than your values and you know, that you should be concerned about their agenda.
17:19
You know, hopefully, for the people who actually do know me, you know, and how much I love
17:25
the foundation work and you know, how I work with my friends or my kids, you know, it's
17:32
very different from the people who just think, oh wow! you know, he's one of these guys who's, you know, pushing levers and
17:40
has too much money and too much authority.
17:45
So, that people misunderstand about you. And talking about misunderstanding, do you...
Mistakes Made by Bill Gates
17:51
have you made any major mistake that people don't know about? Well, some of my mistakes are very public. I mean Microsoft,
18:00
you know, we had lots of products that didn't work and we did have a phone operating system and now,
18:05
you know, Android you know took that position so I certainly,
18:10
you know, messed that up in, in a huge way.
18:17
For the foundation, you know, we often have multiple plans, you know? We, we wanted to have an HIV vaccine,
18:24
we don't have that yet, you know, we're working on a very cheap toilet but it's still
18:30
too expensive. So, that's taking a lot longer. We don't have polio eradication done, I'm still
18:37
very committed to that but it's taking a lot longer than, than we thought it would.
18:44
So, do you... talking about foundation work you have impacted millions of life
18:49
and you spend a lot in making people's lives better.
18:55
What's your biggest challenge today? Because somebody on...
19:00
somebody who's watching this might thing that at your level, with so much
19:05
power, influence, money, you can actually fix a lot of problems. What do you think is your problem... like what challenges do you see here?
19:14
Well, I'm... I love the scientific challenges. I mean we still don't fully understand malnutrition.
19:22
We have some tools to reduce it, it's super exciting, but you know I'm really pushing our
19:29
research workers hard that, okay, you know, we need...
19:34
we need to know more about that. You know, I do think giving money to help the very poorest countries. A lot of which are in Africa,
19:44
you know, Asia, many of the countries are
19:49
having good economic growth and Africa has a lot of unique
19:56
governments or instability or disease challenges and so,
20:02
telling people they should, you know, help out other humans even though they're,
20:08
they're far away and speak a different language. That's not as easy as I thought it would be.
20:15
You know, right now some of the rich countries including my country are cutting their aid budgets and I'm,
20:20
I'm very disappointed that, you know, to me that's not, you know, the golden rule of
20:27
treating people like you'd like to be treated. So, what do you think, all the people who are watching this,
Advice for Young People
20:32
including me, young people should do, so that we could convince more people to help other people?
20:39
Well, when you're young, if you're here in India, you know, you can probably travel,
20:46
you know, some modest distance, an hour or two and see people who don't have the same
20:52
opportunities as you do, that, you know, they're smart but their school's not good or you know, they get
20:58
some health problem and they're not able to access things. I would say in India,
21:03
you know, programs like the aspirational district program, India does
21:10
talk openly, about the places that are the worst off and that's, you know, that's pretty impressive.
21:17
Even issues like sanitation that governments, most governments, you know, you wouldn't catch them talking about toilets
21:24
you know, this country took on a pretty aggressive
21:30
plan and made a lot of progress on that. So, you can go out and see
21:36
people and develop empathy without going too far.
Problems That Money Cannot Fix
21:42
And you've spent hours and hours and days in this country.
21:49
You've spent millions on vaccines and trying to take care of health care challenges.
21:55
What's one problem you feel that money cannot fix.
22:02
You know there's a lot of talk about obesity and
22:09
you know, when I saw the Prime Minister, he was talking about various yoga type things, that you know, people would adopt those.
22:16
But it's been hard, you know, not many countries have gotten the behavior change. You know, maybe India can
22:22
pioneer some approaches there but you know, frankly, and I'll sound like a technologist, the most promising thing is actually,
22:33
you know, a drug, class of drugs called these glp 1 drugs, that
22:38
you know, are going to go off patent and become cheap and you know, so I always like, you know, I'm a little over focused on the
22:45
scientific solution. So, maybe a combination of that behavior change and and the new tools. But behavior change is hard,
22:54
we... we haven't succeeded in that as as much as we'd like to.
23:00
Tell me one behavior we all should adopt. Well, you know, the behavior that's helped
Behaviors Everyone Should Adopt
23:06
me is, is basically being a student all the time, wanting to learn things and being pretty
23:13
brutal with myself. Do I really understand, you know, what's going on, you know, do I understand some AI thing or
23:23
some disease thing and you know, fortunately, I can meet with people who
23:29
in many cases can help me understand and then your knowledge... If you're careful about building your
23:35
knowledge it all kind of connects together but, you know, reading a lot, being a student,
23:42
having people who can teach me that's, you know,
23:48
been not only fun for me but also a big part of my success.
23:54
So, all the people who are watching this, actually feel pretty validated at this point.
23:59
Good. Because this whole podcast is about learning from really, really incredible people like you
24:07
Fantastic. And we have so many questions that we just keep asking to learn more, to learn more, to get inside brains, so
24:14
thanks for validation. Perfect. What's fascinating for me
24:20
this time in your journey, like this time your visit to India. The full gates foundation board is here,
24:26
right? And that's pretty unique and they get to experience India. What do you think, what are your priorities
Perspectives on India
24:34
with regard to this nation? Why is the whole board here? What are you guys trying to figure out?
24:41
What are the things that you're doing? Well, as much progress as we've been part
24:46
of achieving here in India, there's still a lot to do. You know,
24:52
the child to death rate is about a third of what it was but it's still,
24:58
almost three times higher than in a rich country. So, we, you know, we should all want to close that gap.
25:05
That's equity. I mentioned malnutrition,
25:11
you know, the country's very serious about that and yet, you know, it means that your brain never develops and sadly
25:21
if whatever dietary or disease things affect you
25:27
during pregnancy in your first year even if later you get a fantastic diet,
25:33
your brain and your physical capabilities they don't
25:39
adjust you're, you know, sort of permanently affected and so,
25:44
we're working with some great scientists here, we have a lot of the tools of biology have gotten a lot better so, I do think
25:52
you know, in the next decade we will totally get to the bottom of that
25:57
and, you know, I'm thrilled to do that. And a lot of the scientists we partner with,
26:03
you know, including some from icmr but lots of institutions around the country
26:09
they're also Committed to that. So, you work hear a lot and with the foundation you work around the world,
Accuracy of Predictions
26:17
a lot of things and because of all of this passion and data
26:23
and this intention to try to help people. You've been pretty accurate in trying to understand trends
26:31
way before people like normal people. Let's say you were pretty accurate in so many things,
26:36
in predicting so many epidemics as well. Is there something that you know which we don't?
26:45
Like how do you spot these things way faster? well, the biggest change agent
26:51
in my lifetime has been the the miracle of digital, you know, now
26:58
moving into the AI phase of that digital revolution. So, the fact that as a young person,
27:04
you know, I was programming at age thirteen and by you know eighteen I had my,
27:11
you know, thousands of hours of really strong feedback about you know getting better and
27:18
being pushed. And so, they... it's a really lucky thing
27:25
to have such a familiarity with the thing that's
27:30
going to change the world. And so, you know, that I wrote a book called 'The Road Ahead' a long time ago.
27:37
You know, that talked about the Internet and digital money and
27:42
video conferencing and then when I moved into the foundation work the health work,
27:48
you know, people in that community understand pandemics and you know, so, my saying
27:54
"hey, you know, there's a big risk and the thing that's gonna kill, you know, ten million additional people is likely to be a pandemic"
28:04
you know, that's commonplace knowledge if you're in the global health community, it's a very small community
28:10
but I was just somebody who is listened to stating
28:17
this and sadly, you know, most people who listened to that prediction,
28:22
listened to it after it came true, than, you know, what my goal was, was for people to hear that and actually
28:29
stop it from happening. that's usually the case, right? Like people listen to
28:36
pieces, golden advice pieces and pieces of nuggets way after the time has been passed, right?
28:42
Because of this do you fear anything today? I definitely hope that we shape
Things He Fears
28:49
AI in a positive way. It's such a big
28:55
impact on, you know, being smarter than humans,
29:01
that it will change our world a lot. And it's, you know, it's definitely new territory.
29:08
So, I have a list of about five things, you know, AI, shaping AI properly is at the top of that list but, you know, avoiding
29:16
the next pandemic, avoiding nuclear war, bioterrorism, climate change, it's only about five or six things that we need to
29:26
minimize the chance of.
29:31
And use our additional wealth and insights, you know, against those things.
Personal Fears
29:37
Do you have any personal fear? What's your biggest fear? You know, it's not like I'm afraid of heights or planes or fire
29:43
or anything like that. You know, I hope I'm... I'll be sad if my brain
29:50
gets less capable, you know? Which I'm... as I turn 70 this year,
29:55
you know, I'd be lucky to have twenty years of, you know, being able to learn.
30:01
You know, maybe I'll get lucky and get a little bit more but, you know, that disappoints me because I've
30:07
had such an amazing time learning things and I,
30:13
I used to think of old people as not, you know, contributing all that much.
30:18
And now I've had to change my mind about how important old people are.
30:24
Do you feel the difference? I don't, I don't at all. You know, probably if I
30:30
took an IQ test, I would do a little bit worse than when I was twenty five.
30:36
But you know I've accumulated enough knowledge, you know, so wisdom
30:41
can compensate a little bit for a slight reduction in intelligence and I do think it's like a muscle that
30:48
if you're pushing yourself to think and learn that you know you stay,
30:56
it really helps your capabilities a lot. But yeah, I have a fear that
31:04
eventually I'll loose, you know, I won't want to pick up a five hundred page book. I'll look at it go are you kidding,
31:10
I'm done with that. So, with age you have not felt any changes in your brain?
31:16
Not really (unclear) Wow! No, I don't think so.
31:23
You know, whenever you can't remember something you're like, oh no! now? But...
31:29
You know, so, maybe a tiny bit of that but then you know, it's ,just a little bit because you're
31:36
looking for it, you know, when I was in my twenties, if I can't remember something, then I was like so what?
31:43
So, is there any change you feel? Because Bill Gates at twenty five and Bill Gates at seventy,
Being a Maniac in His 20s
31:50
is there any change that you feel personally? Well, in my twenties I was... I chose to focus on one topic, from, you know, age twenty to about
32:00
thirty one or two. I
32:05
told myself, hey, I love biology and math and all these things but I want to be this
32:12
person who's advancing software faster than anyone else. And so, I really did
32:19
narrow my focus and I, I didn't, you know, take much time off and I could stay in the office you know,
32:28
Seventy two hours and then crash and so my adrenaline
32:34
and... was really Unique. Now my understanding of how to manage people
32:42
other than myself wasn't that, that good. You know, I, I look back and
32:48
you know, I've learned a lot since then but just my stamina and focus for that period of my life, you know, being
32:57
kind of a maniac. was the right thing. And, you know, I...
33:03
You know, my competitors would say, "oh no, you work too hard" and I'd say, "yes, I do"
33:09
Do you think that's a great advice for every young person who's watching? Well... Be a maniac in your twenties?
33:14
It's not for everyone but if you're, if you're in a race
33:21
and you know, the... A little bit,
33:26
moving a little bit faster, can make a difference
33:31
than yes, your, your twenties, when you have no wife and children
33:38
that's the time to do it. that's the time to be little maniac about certain things, right?
33:44
You also just mentioned that you love learning, which obviously the world knows but during this conversation also, you just
33:51
talked about it like little bit again and again. What are you currently learning? Or what do you want to learn now? Well, there's a lot
What He Is Currently Learning
33:59
going on. You know, AI just staying on top of that
34:05
is you know, I, I very much enjoyed that and I get to sit and talk with the top people at open AI and I get to play around with things
34:15
but then when you think, okay, now what about AI applied to mental health care,
34:22
isn't that one of the most exciting things because you know, we can never have enough therapists
34:29
and even people who aren't, you know, suffering massively,
34:35
you know, maybe we could help even People with mild
34:41
Symptoms, so, you know, what does this AI companion look like
34:47
and how can that help us. My friend Reid Hoffman,
34:53
just wrote a book called 'Superagency' there he's got a really good chapter about this, so,
34:59
I'm pushing myself to try and understand, you know,
35:04
what can we do there and meet the people who are you know pushing the the boundaries
35:10
because I see such potential. So, what would you advise young people
What Young People Should Start Learning
35:15
to start learning today and from where? AI itself? Well, if you have a mathematical
35:22
mind, you know, not everyone should learn AI. You know, these tools are going to be available
35:30
to everyone and so you ought to be a user of AI but the underlying
35:36
stuff, you know, that's a pretty narrow set of people who will have an opportunity to,
35:43
you know, push on a new training method. And even people who grew up with software,
35:49
some of them don't really get this because it's, it's a bit more mathematical than it is just a
35:55
a programming type thing. So, it's as a user
36:01
that, okay, if you're... you like doing creative work, yes, AI is gonna change your world and AI hopefully can help you
36:11
do things faster and better. So, my prescription would be, yes, to use it for the
36:18
areas that you're excited about. Any area that you're excited about, learn about that and try to make a bridge between AI and that industry.
36:27
Right, I mean, the Internet has so much educational material on it.
36:33
So, between all that material and then an AI that can help,
36:39
you know, take long documents and you can have a dialogue with it. You know, you can do your tax.
36:46
You can now do these... generate podcasts about things, it's a, it's a great time to be a learner, right?
36:52
You know, when I was young, I had to go to the library and you know, read the encyclopedia alphabetically,
36:58
know multimedia, this is a, a paradise.
37:04
Yeah. Thanks to you guys. because... The digital world. Yeah, the digital world. You've made it easy for us.
37:10
We don't know the world, what it'd look like to go to library and read about something.
37:15
We get fidgety if you don't get an answer in three seconds. We have last two questions for you.
India’s Contribution to the Gates Foundation’s Strategies
37:22
One is, in your philanthropy work with the foundation. How is India
37:28
contributing to your global strategies? Well, more and more of the innovation
37:34
is being done in India. India's, you know, got
37:39
a depth of talent and a desire for frugal solutions
37:45
and so, even though the rich world, US, Europe, you know, we have a lot of talents, for some basic science thing like
37:51
immunology, a lot of the new insights will keep coming
37:56
from those institutions. But when it comes to actually putting the pieces together, including something like AI for
38:03
healthcare,you know, I was just meeting with a number of companies working on very piece...
38:08
various piece of that in India and so, the, you know, we need
38:15
better seeds and we need better weather advice for farmers and so,
38:20
although we're gonna continue to do a lot of implementation here in India, help, you know, get things rolled out,
38:26
more and more of our sort of product research work will be done here.
38:33
Both because it benefits India but you know, we're also very good if,
38:39
if it's savings Indian children, really working well, you know, our foundation
38:45
has a lot of presence in Africa, so, even take, you know, the classic example where India was
38:53
totally the leader on this digital public infrastructure, the digital money and identity aadhaar, thing.
39:00
You know, funding the Africans to come here and learn and for their budgets and helping to create the
39:06
open source software that makes it easy for them. You know, that's now a huge agenda item which is kind of a south-south thing
39:13
with the little bit of facilitation from us. Got it. And
What People Should Think When They Hear “Bill Gates”
39:19
here's the last question. If you had...
39:24
if the world had to write one sentence next to the name Bill Gates,
39:30
what would you want them to write? You know, I don't do my work, you know, based on some epitaph,
39:36
you know, ideally, you know, they'd say that, wow! there were these diseases,
39:41
around, you know, polio and malaria and malnutrition and you know, now we don't have to think about that,
39:49
you know, partly because he championed,
39:54
you know, putting more great thinking and resources into ending those problems and so...
40:03
you know, I hope people look at the word polio and go what was that?
40:08
You know, when you read Dicken's novels and they talk about somebody had consumptions, like what is that? Well that's actually
40:14
TB, so, we still... not in the UK, we don't have much but we,
40:19
we still do, they just changed the word. so, you know, hopefully some problems,
40:26
that we can actually finish and, and then move on.
40:31
Which problem do you think will be finishing first? Well, polio, you know, I expect even in five years
Problems That Will Be Solved in the Next 5 Years
40:38
and that'll give us the credibility to go after things like malaria and measles.
40:46
That's amazing. Oh, it's gonna be fun. It's Amazing. If in five years
40:51
we can make that a reality, it's going to be incredible for the humankind, it's wow!
40:58
I'm excited. Yeah, it has happened, only once smallpox was eliminated back in 1980, so, you know, polio,
41:04
a serious disease it's gonna be the second. Wow! I,
41:09
really, truly, wish that it happens faster than what we've just talked about. That's good. And I hope like more in...
41:16
by the time, the foundation gets in full fledgedly in the work. I believe
41:21
instead of not two three there could be multiple of them, so that you lose counting, that should be the goal and I'm expecting for it.
41:28
Well, thank you so much for doing this sir. It was a pleasure having you.
Thanks for Listening
41:34
When I was a kid, I was growing up in school, just,
41:39
you were the richest person in the world. Before I gave it away.
41:45
So, your name would pop up, so, just to talk about you and how you made your money was a proud feeling in school and in friend circle,
41:52
everybody would respect you that, oh! you know so much about this person and that. From there, that kid sitting right in front of you and trying to,
42:02
you know... being in a situation where I'm sitting with you and figuring out what's going on in your brain,
42:07
it's an incredible opportunity, I'm so grateful. Thank you so much for doing this, it's a dream come true.
42:13
Great. We'll have to do it again. Yes. We need to. I've got you on camera now. Thank you.
42:19
Thank you. Pleasure.
